## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Disabled CORS
- API endpoint for getting the active connection:
```
GET /connection

{
  ...
  "connection-id": "..."
}

```
- When using `POST /build` the response also includes the `connection-id`, and `params`
- When using `POST /eval` the response also includes the `connection-id`, `query`, and `params`.
- In case of an error, it is handled and the error message is returned in the API response as `error`

### Fixed
- Pine expression build/eval was failing if the db connection isn't initialized
- An error was being thrown when using `uuid` values in the expressions: `operator does not exist: uuid = character varying`

## [0.3.1] - 2022-02-14
### Added
- API endpoint for building expressions:
```
POST /build
{
  "expression": "user"
}


{
  ...
  "query": "\nSELECT user_0.* FROM \"user\" AS user_0 WHERE true;\n"
}
```

- API endpoint for evaluating expressions:
```
POST /eval
{
  "expression": "user"
}

{
  ...
  "result": [
    {
      "email": "john@acme.com",
      "name": "John Doe",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
- API endpoint for setting the connection:
```
PUT /connection
{
  "connection-id": "default"
}

{
  "connection-id": "default"
}
```
- API endpoint for getting the connections
```
GET /connections

[
  "result": [ "default", "mysql-test" ]
]
```

### Deprecated

  the default connection.
